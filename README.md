For work experience at age 17, my team (of 3) and I created this website.
The work experience was organised by RoweIT, who set the brief to create a website to promote safety in the sea. I was in-charge of the backend - the APIs and JavaScript.
I also contributed to several of the HTML pages and their corresponding CSS files.
